### Logical split
The continent mirrors america, asia and europe contain the archive mirrors as well as repository mirrors. The city mirrors have just the repositories hosted.

## Requirements
- Host with Arch Linux installed
- root access provided
- Enough storage to host repos / debugrepos (at least)
- Bandwidth (depends on location)

## Adding a new mirror box
- Add new entries in `hosts` file under `mirrors` and `geo_mirrors` sections
- Adjust terraform `tf-stage1/archlinux.tf` to include the IPv4 and IPv6 entries of the new server
- Adjust terraform `tf-stage1/templates.tf` to include the IPv4 and IPv6 entries of the new server as a `NS` record for `geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com`
- Add a new files in `host_vars`
    - `host_vars/<fqdn>/misc`
        Containing all the information for the mirror itself
    - `host_vars/<fqdn>/vault_wireguard.yml`
        Containing the wireguard private key in encrypted vault
