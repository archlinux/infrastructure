## accounts.archlinux.org

This server is _special_. It runs keycloak and is central to our unified Arch Linux account management world.
It has an Ansible playbook for the keycloak service but that only installs the package and starts it but it's configured via a secondary Terraform file only for keycloak `keycloak.tf`.
The reason for doing it this way is that Terraform support for Keycloak is much superior and it's declarative too which is great for making sure that no old config remains in the case of config changes.

So to set up this server from scratch, run:

  - `cd tf-stage1`
  - `terraform apply`
  - `cd ../tf-stage2`
  - `terraform import keycloak_realm.master master`
  - `terraform apply`

### Services
