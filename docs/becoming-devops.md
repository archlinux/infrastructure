# Becoming Arch Linux DevOps

In Arch Linux, DevOps are expected to be reliable, trusthworthy, and self-directed.
DevOps should be known and trusted by the community beforehand or be recommended by previous
members.

## Junior DevOps program

In order to become a full DevOps, the applicant must first join the Junior DevOps program. This
program requires applicants to

0) have contributed to Arch multiple times in some meaningful ways,
1) find two sponsors, and
2) write an application to the arch-devops mailing list.

The idea of Junior DevOps is that they don't get full access to all secrets and machines as opposed
to full DevOps but access within the limited scope on which they have been assigned rights to work
on. As trust grows the scope on which the Junior DevOps operates may be extended, while their
sponsors are expected to help them learn and should feel responsible to review any meaningful
changes.

However, Junior DevOps can already help with many tasks and are expected to take charge of a given
topic.

After a lot of trust is built up, Junior DevOps may graduate to become full DevOps. This usually
takes 3-9 months.
