## TEMPLATES_FOLDER, and DATABASE_URL to local paths and/or a remote database
## location.

### General settings ###
########################

## Domain settings
## The domain must match the address from where you access the server
## It's recommended to configure this value, otherwise certain functionality might not work,
## like attachment downloads, email links and U2F.
## For U2F to work, the server must use HTTPS, you can use Let's Encrypt for free certs
## To use HTTPS, the recommended way is to put Vaultwarden behind a reverse proxy
## Details:
## - https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS
## - https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples

## A comma-separated list means only those users can create orgs:

### SMTP Email settings ###

## Mail specific settings, set SMTP_FROM and either SMTP_HOST or USE_SENDMAIL to enable the mail service.

## - "off": The default port is 25.
## Ports 587 (submission) and 25 (smtp) are standard without encryption and with encryption via STARTTLS (Explicit TLS). Port 465 (submissions) is used for encrypted submission (Implicit TLS).
