## Anubis has the ability to let you import snippets of configuration into the main
## configuration file. This allows you to break up your config into smaller parts
## that get logically assembled into one big file.
##
## Of note, a bot rule can either have inline bot configuration or import a
## bot config snippet. You cannot do both in a single bot rule.
##
## Import paths can either be prefixed with (data) to import from the common/shared
## rules in the data folder in the Anubis source tree or will point to absolute/relative
## paths in your filesystem. If you don't have access to the Anubis source tree, check
## /usr/share/docs/anubis/data or in the tarball you extracted Anubis from.

# By default, send HTTP 200 back to clients that either get issued a challenge
# or a denial. This seems weird, but this is load-bearing due to the fact that
# the most aggressive scraper bots seem to really, really, want an HTTP 200 and
# will stop sending requests once they get it.
status_codes:
  CHALLENGE: 200
  DENY: 200

#     weight
#   - action: the Anubis action to apply, similar to in a bot policy
#   - challenge: which challenge to send to the user, similar to in a bot policy

# See https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/configuration/thresholds for more

  # For clients that had some weight reduced through custom rules, give them a
