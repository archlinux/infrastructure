# This variable describe the program to use for regenerating the transport map
# db file, from the associated plain text files.  The file being updated will
# be appended to this string (with a separating space), so it must be
# appropriate for os.system().

# This variable describes the type of transport maps that will be generated by
# mailman to be used with postfix for LMTP transport. By default, it is set to
# hash, but mailman also supports `regex` tables.
