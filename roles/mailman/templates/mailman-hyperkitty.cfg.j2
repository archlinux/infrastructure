# This is the mailman extension configuration file to enable HyperKitty as an
# archiver. Remember to add the following lines in the mailman.cfg file:
#
# [archiver.hyperkitty]
# class: mailman_hyperkitty.Archiver
# enable: yes
# configuration: /path/to/here/mailman-hyperkitty.cfg
#

[general]

# This is your HyperKitty installation, preferably on the localhost. This
# address will be used by Mailman to forward incoming emails to HyperKitty
# for archiving. It does not need to be publicly available, in fact it's
# better if it is not.
# However, if your Mailman installation is accessed via HTTPS, the URL needs
# to match your SSL certificate (e.g. https://lists.example.com/hyperkitty).
base_url: http://localhost:8000/archives/

# The shared api_key, must be identical except for quoting to the value of
# MAILMAN_ARCHIVER_KEY in HyperKitty's settings.
api_key: {{ vault_mailman_archiver_key }}
