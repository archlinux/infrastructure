# NOTE: This script is a copy of the syncrepo-template.sh script in the same
# directory.  It is a copy instead of being a template because the template is
# linked in the wiki. People that follow the link and want to use the script
# should populate the variables themselves and not be influenced by the values we
# are using.

# NOTE: If you perform changes to this script, also consider changing the template!

# This is a simple mirroring script. To save bandwidth it first checks a
# timestamp via HTTP and only runs rsync when the timestamp differs from the
# local copy. As of 2016, a single rsync run without changes transfers roughly
# 6MiB of data which adds up to roughly 250GiB of traffic per month when rsync
# is run every minute. Performing a simple check via HTTP first can thus save a
# lot of traffic.

# Directory where the repo is stored locally. Example: /srv/repo
target="/srv/ftp"

# Directory where files are downloaded to before being moved in place.
# This should be on the same filesystem as $target, but not a subdirectory of $target.
# Example: /srv/tmp
tmp="/srv/syncrepo-tmp"

# Lockfile path
lock="/var/lock/syncrepo.lck"

# If you want to limit the bandwidth used by rsync set this.
# Use 0 to disable the limit.
# The default unit is KiB (see man rsync /--bwlimit for more)
bwlimit=0

# The source URL of the mirror you want to sync from.
# If you are a tier 1 mirror use rsync.archlinux.org, for example like this:
# rsync://rsync.archlinux.org/ftp_tier1
# Otherwise chose a tier 1 mirror from this list and use its rsync URL:
# https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/
source_url='rsync://rsync.archlinux.org/ftp_tier1'

# An HTTP(S) URL pointing to the 'lastupdate' file on your chosen mirror.
# If you are a tier 1 mirror use: http://rsync.archlinux.org/lastupdate
# Otherwise use the HTTP(S) URL from your chosen mirror.
lastupdate_url='http://rsync.archlinux.org/lastupdate'
