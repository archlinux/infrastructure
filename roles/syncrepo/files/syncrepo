# This is a simple mirroring script. To save bandwidth it first checks a
# timestamp via HTTP and only runs rsync when the timestamp differs from the
# local copy. As of 2016, a single rsync run without changes transfers roughly
# 6MiB of data which adds up to roughly 250GiB of traffic per month when rsync
# is run every minute. Performing a simple check via HTTP first can thus save a
# lot of traffic.

# NOTE: You'll probably want to change this or set it to 0 to disable the limit
# The default unit is KiB (see man rsync /--bwlimit for more)

# NOTE: Most people reading this very likely need to change this since
# rsync.archlinux.org requires you to be a tier 1 mirror
